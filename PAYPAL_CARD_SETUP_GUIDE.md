## ðŸ”§ Required PayPal Account Setup

### Step 1: Enable Advanced Credit and Debit Card Payments

1. **Go to PayPal Developer Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://developer.paypal.com/
   - Sign in and select your app

2. **Enable ACDC Feature:**
   - Go to your app â†’ "Features" tab
   - Find "Advanced Credit and Debit Card Payments"
   - Click "Enable" (this is crucial for card payments)
   - Accept the terms and conditions

3. **Verify App Settings:**
   - Ensure "Accept payments" is enabled
   - Ensure "PayPal Checkout" is enabled
   - Ensure "Advanced Credit and Debit Card Payments" shows as "Active"

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file has the correct Sandbox Client ID:

```env
# Replace with your actual Sandbox Client ID
EXPO_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=AZabc123...your-sandbox-client-id
```

### Step 3: Test with Proper Sandbox Cards

Use these PayPal Sandbox test cards:

**Visa (Success):**
- Card: 4032035728926109
- Expiry: Any future date
- CVV: Any 3 digits

**Mastercard (Success):**
- Card: 5555555555554444  
- Expiry: Any future date
- CVV: Any 3 digits

**Visa (Decline - for testing):**
- Card: 4000000000000002
- Expiry: Any future date  
- CVV: Any 3 digits

## ðŸš« Common Issues & Solutions

### "This card can't be used" Error

**Cause:** ACDC not enabled or wrong environment
**Solution:** 
1. Enable ACDC in PayPal app settings (Step 1 above)
2. Use Sandbox cards with Sandbox Client ID
3. Never mix Live cards with Sandbox environment

### Card Fields Not Showing

**Cause:** Missing components in SDK URL
**Solution:** Already fixed in code - SDK now loads with `components=buttons,card-fields`

### 403 Forbidden on Payment Insert

**Cause:** Supabase RLS policies
**Solution:** Run the `fix-paypal-rls.sql` script in Supabase SQL Editor
