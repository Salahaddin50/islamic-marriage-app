3. **Request ACDC Feature:**
   - Go to your Live app ‚Üí Features
   - Request "Advanced Credit and Debit Card Payments"

## üîç Current Issue Analysis

Your card declines are happening because:

1. **ACDC Not Approved Yet**
   - Live ACDC requires PayPal business approval
   - Cards will be declined until approved

2. **Business Not Verified**
   - PayPal requires verified business account
   - Unverified accounts have limitations

3. **Missing Compliance**
   - Live environment has stricter requirements
   - Need proper business documentation

## ‚úÖ Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Wait for ACDC Approval
- Apply for Live ACDC in PayPal Developer Dashboard
- Wait for PayPal approval (1-3 business days)
- Cards will work after approval

### Option 2: PayPal-Only (Temporary)
- Disable card payments temporarily
- Only show PayPal button
- Works immediately with verified business account

### Option 3: Switch to Sandbox for Testing
- Use Sandbox for development/testing
- Switch to Live only when ready for production
- Easier for testing and development

## üõ† Code Changes for Live Environment

Remove the testing helper UI and update error messages:

```typescript
// Remove sandbox testing UI
// Update error messages for Live environment
// Use Live Client ID in .env
```

## üìã Action Plan

1. **Verify Business Account** ‚úÖ (Must be done first)
2. **Apply for Live ACDC** ‚è≥ (Submit application)
3. **Wait for Approval** ‚è≥ (1-3 business days)
4. **Update Code** ‚è≥ (Remove sandbox references)
5. **Test with Real Cards** ‚è≥ (After approval)

## üö´ Why Cards Are Declining

- **"Card declined by issuing bank"** = ACDC not approved yet
- **"We weren't able to add this card"** = Feature not enabled for Live

The cards themselves are probably fine - it's the PayPal Live setup that needs completion.
