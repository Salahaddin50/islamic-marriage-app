- Helper functions for upgrades and color management

## Testing

2. Try selecting different packages
3. Check crown color changes
4. View payment records
5. Test upgrade pricing logic

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('user_packages', 'payment_records', 'package_features', 'crown_colors');

-- View package features
SELECT * FROM package_features ORDER BY package_type, sort_order;

-- Check crown colors
SELECT * FROM crown_colors;
```

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Supabase logs for database errors
2. Verify all tables were created correctly
3. Ensure RLS policies are properly configured
4. Test with different user accounts

The system is now ready for use with manual payment processing. Payment gateway integration can be added as the next phase of development.
